            This sub-test requires you to learn grammar and vocabulary in an unfamiliar language. There is first a 5
            minute long <em>training phase</em> where you study correspondences between pictures and sentences that
            describe the pictures. This is followed by a <em>test phase</em> where you are shown pictures that have to
            be matched with their correct sentences.
            <p class="bg-info">You can take any written notes that you need.</p>
